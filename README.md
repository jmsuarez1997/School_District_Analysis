# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
A city school district has tasked us with preparing all standardized test scores for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights and patterns. The data also contains school names,  budgets, and sizes. The information is presented to the school board to decide where to allocate funding. 

Thomas High School's ninth-grade class showed evidence of academic dishonesty on the standardized test scores. The board wants to uphold the state testing standards and has asked to replace the reading and math scores with NaNs. A comparison of the district summary before and after the NaN change will be shown.
## Results
